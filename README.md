# A Static website for an organic restaurant
This project was created to test my knowledge in HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript.

## General Info
This project is a static website designed for a fictional restaurant. The website contains their best menu offers, information about a online tutorial class.

## Technologies
This project was created using:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript
*  A Tecno AB7 phone.

## Project Status
Under development. Responsiveness on major devices yet to be achieved.

## Inspiration
This website is based on a restaurant website template provided on **[NICEPAGE](https://nicepage.com/html-templates/preview/recipes-and-cook-lessons-148837?device=desktop)**.

## Features
-  A slide navigation menu with CSS and VanillaJS
-  A menu section
-  An about section created using grid.
-  A section containing posts and reviews created using flexbox.
-  A tutorial information section containing a slideshow, imbedded modal images, and responsiveness using basic javascript.
- An image gallery created using flexbox.
- Icon links to social media pages (only the Twitter is functional. It opens to my Twitter page. Drop a follow.)

## Project Issues.
The website seems to look quite alright and neatly arranged on different screens width. But there is a slight issue with the "reviews" flexbox. It's out of place and in a view-width of 667px, the review section and tutorial section seems to overlap.
